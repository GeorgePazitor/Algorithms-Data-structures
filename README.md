# C_exercises
Exercises from Algorithms and Data structures Laboratories
This repository contains C code files that cover different topics among the Algorithms and Data structures theory such as:
Linked lists, Heap, Queues, Stacks;
Abstract Data types;
Multifile C programming;
Graphs and basic algorithms related;
Optimization problems and different approaches related: dividi et impera paradigm with use of combinatorial calculus models, dynamic programming paradigm;
All the proposed solutions were implemented by me during the semester. No solutions were proposed later by proferssors.
